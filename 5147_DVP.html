                And it will surely occupy at least a page in future
                literatures. The debuting of COVID has brought significant impacts to the world, though, some may see it
                as a marvellous opportunity while some may see it as a catastrophe. The attitude of a sovereign, or even
                a nation, determine its behavioural decisions as well as its countermeasure towards COVID to a great
                extent. Speaking of national level of point of view, each nation’s strategies in manging the pandemic
                largely varied. In essence, it is a dilemma of putting either the economy or social stability as the top
                priority at that one specific timeframe. “It’s just a flu” has been a famous quote of former president
                of the U.S. – Donald Trump during the initial stage of the pandemic. This data exploration study
                attempts to examine such statement, to see whether it was just a soothing statement or in fact, it was a
                scientific conclusion.

    <div class="CFR">
        <h1 class="CFR_h1">Case Fatality Rate Comparison between 2009 Pandemic & COVID-19</h1>
        <p class="CFR_p">Fatality can be simply referred to the death rate per 100 cases of an infectious disease. When
            performing statistical analysis of fatality, there have been three mainstream approaches including Case
            Fatality Rate (CFR), Infectious Fatality Rate (IFR) and Crude Mortality Rate. CFR has been a popular
            approach and often cited by media when risk of death of COVID-19 is discussed; It is calculated through
            “number of death / total of diagnosed cases * 100“ while IFR is calculated as “number of death / total
            number of infected * 100”. Ideally, IFR seems to be the best approach to answer the question of “how deadly
            the disease is ?”, however, total number of infected is often not known especially for COVID-19 as there are
            many people who were symptomless and thus had not been diagnosed as a case. Therefore, CFR becomes a
            reasonable choice for media as well as the current study in comparing the fatality rate of the diseases.</p>

        <p class="CFR_p">seasonal flu, as the extension of H1N1 - 2009 pandemic, appeared to share high similarities
            with COVID-19 in terms of fatality rate (deadliness). Therefore, the estimated burden of seasonal flu
            adapted from U.S. CDC (2022) was examined and provided as the following visualization.</p>

    <div class="linechart1">
        <h1 class="CFR_h1">Coincidence?</h1>
        <p class="CFR_p">The visualization revealed a similar degree of fluctuating patterns in all ‘Symptomatic
            Illness’, ‘Medical Visit’ and ‘Hospitalization’ with a commonality of a notable plummeting following by the
            first debuting of the disease. This also happened to match with current COVID-19 patterns, which is shown as
            the following.</p>
        <p class="CFR_p">Inferring based on this theoretical thought, COVID-19 will be very likely to have a significant
            bounce back in the upcoming year and will thereafter be fluctuating at a certain level existing just like a
            seasonal and flu-like infectious disease.</p>
